## VARIABLES
```
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"
```

### Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).
Rules for Python variables:
- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character;
- A variable name cannot start with a number;
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ );
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables);
- A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

### Python Keywords

## CASTING
```
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
```
