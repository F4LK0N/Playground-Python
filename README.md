# PYTHON

## RUN
```shell
./main.py
```

## COMMENTS
```python
#This is a comment

"""
This is a multiline comment.
Actually this is a literal string,
that will be ignored by the compiler.
"""
```

## VARIABLES
```python
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"
```

### Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).
Rules for Python variables:
- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character;
- A variable name cannot start with a number;
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ );
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables);
- A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

### Python Keywords
```python
and as assert break class continue def del elif else except False finally for from global if import in is lambda None nonlocal not or pass raise return True try while with yield
```

## DATATYPES
```python
x = "Hello World"	# str
x = 20	# int
x = 20.5	# float
x = 1j	# complex
x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]	# list
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")	# tuple
x = range(6)	# range
x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}	# dict
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}	# set
x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})	# frozenset
x = True	# bool
x = b"Hello"	# bytes
x = bytearray(5)	# bytearray
x = memoryview(bytes(5))	# memoryview
x = None	# NoneType
```

## CASTING
```python
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
```
